  # Final Fix for Doctors Table RLS

  1. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies for doctors table
    - Remove role-based checks in favor of direct auth checks
    - Grant proper permissions to authenticated users

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS with proper policies
    - Ensure authenticated users can read
    - Allow admins full access through direct auth checks
