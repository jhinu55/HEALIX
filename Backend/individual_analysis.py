Analyze the following patient health records chronologically and provide both analysis and recommendations in two sections:

SECTION 1 - TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:
1. Temporal patterns in vital signs and health metrics
2. Trends in chronic conditions or symptoms
3. Changes in overall health status over time
4. Notable improvements or deteriorations
5. Key health events or significant changes

Patient Health Records (Time Series): {record}

Analysis should highlight:
- Short-term changes (recent visits)
- Long-term trends (across all visits)
- Patterns in vital signs
- Changes in symptoms or conditions
- Risk factor progression

SECTION 2 - RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Time-sensitive recommendations:
   - Immediate interventions needed
   - Short-term monitoring requirements
   - Long-term management strategies

2. Progressive care plan:
   - Frequency of follow-up visits
   - Monitoring schedule for vital signs
   - Timeline for preventive screenings
   - Adjustments to current treatments

3. Risk mitigation strategies:
   - Lifestyle modifications
   - Preventive measures
   - Early intervention triggers
   - Regular assessment points
